* Written description of three observable trends based on the data.

On Latitude vs. Temperature
1. Based on the arc of the data points, Latitudes between -20,40 have the highest max temperatures. Specifically, these cities around the equator see temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 90+ degrees.

On Latitude vs. Humidity
2. There appears to be a correlation between latitudes of -20 or higher and humidity above 80%. In particular, there is a correlation between latitudes in the range 20,60 and humidity above 60%. 

On Latitude vs. Cloudiness
3. Based on the sparsity of the points, there does not appear to be a trend between city latitude and the respective cloudiness.

On Latitude vs. Wind Speed
4. Wind speeds across the board tend to be between 0,10 regardless of Latitude. However, higher positive latitudes do experience a broader range of wind speeds than their negative counterparts.
